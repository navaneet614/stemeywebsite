Richard Henry,John Hopkins University,Physics,Astronomy & Applied Physics,Physics is Simple! ,"Dick Henry is an astronomer, who has fallen in love with physics, and who loves to talk about the nature of physics! Dick always thought physics was very difficult; indeed incomprehensible; until he finally saw through it! He will tell you how to get there fast! The essential discovery was made thousands of years ago by Pythagoras in Greece, and even earlier by others in India and China. The universe is mathematical in its very bones. And high-school mathematics is all that you need to grasp that. ","Richard Conn Henry was born in Toronto, Canada, in 1940 and won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, while attaining his BA at the University of Toronto in 1962; in 1967 he received his PhD in Astronomy from Princeton and then he spent two years doing space research at the US Naval Research Laboratory before becoming an Assistant Professor of Physics at the Johns Hopkins University. After his first year at Hopkins, he took a year off to see the world, hitch-hiking across the Sahara desert, climbing Kimimanjaro, and going down the Nile on a barge; on to India, and the south Pacific. Back at Hopkins for Apollo 17 – dinner in the famous control room at Houston, while the astronauts, on the way home from the moon, observed his targets with the Hopkins ultraviolet spectrometer. Then Deputy Director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division for two years, successfully selling the Hubble Space Telescope to President Jimmy Carter. His research centers on cosmic diffuse ultraviolet background radiation from the universe. "
Xia Yang,UCLA,Biology,Integrative Biology and Bioinformatics,Dissecting Complex Human Diseases via Big Data Bioinformatics and Systems Biology,"Complex human diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease involve complex cross-talks of many organs, tissues, cells, and biomolecules that are challenging to dissect. Thanks to recent technological advances that have enabled an outpour of biomedical big data, we are now positioned to piece together the puzzles of complex diseases. Our research aims to develop and utilize powerful bioinformatics and systems biology approaches to harmonize and integrate biomedical big data from human and model systems to dissect the molecular networks of complex human diseases. In this talk, I will introduce i) the importance and development of bioinformatics tools to accommodate diverse data types (genetic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, etc) for network modeling of disease systems, and ii) the application of big data systems biology approaches in understanding cardiometabolic and brain disorders. These efforts have led to the elucidation of systems-level tissue-specific and cell-specific networks and critical regulators either specific to individual diseases or shared between diseases. The systems and network level insights will help guide the development of network-based medicine for common complex human diseases.","Xia Yang, Ph.D., (https://yanglab.ibp.ucla.edu) is currently a tenured Professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology and a faculty member of the Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences at UCLA. Her lab focuses on developing and applying multi-tissue multi-omics systems biology approaches to understand the gene networks perturbed by genetic and environmental risks of complex human diseases, ranging from cardiometabolic diseases to neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. She received her PhD in Molecular Genetics with an emphasis on Bioinformatics from Georgia State University and obtained postdoctoral training in Systems Genetics at UCLA under the guidance of Dr. A. Jake Lusis. She subsequently worked as Senior Scientist at Rosetta Inpharmatics/Merck & Co. and Director of Systems Biology at Sage Bionetworks before returning to UCLA as a faculty member."
Jamie Spangler,John Hopkins University,Chemistry,Biomedical Engineering,Engineering proteins to reprogram the immune response,"Nature offers us a finite pool of proteins, and many of these molecules trigger
multiple contradictory effects, which limits their performance as potential drugs. Our lab
combines cutting-edge tools from biochemistry and engineering to redesign existing proteins or
create entirely new proteins to address the deficiencies of molecules found in nature. In
particular, we focus on engineering proteins that regulate the immune system to develop targeted
therapeutics to treat diseases including cancer, HIV, and diabetes.","Dr. Jamie Spangler earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and went on to conduct her Ph.D. research in Biological Engineering in Professor K. Dane Wittrup’s group at MIT, studying antibody-mediated down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor as a new mechanism for cancer therapy. She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Professor K. Christopher Garcia’s lab in the Molecular & Cellular Physiology and Structural Biology departments at Stanford University School of Medicine, focusing on engineering cytokine systems to bias immune homeostasis. Dr. Spangler launched her independent research group at Johns Hopkins University in July 2017, jointly between the departments of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. Her lab, located in the Translational Tissue Engineering Center at the School of Medicine, applies structural and mechanistic insights to re-engineer existing proteins and design new proteins that therapeutically modulate the immune response. In particular, her group is interested in engineering immune molecules such as cytokines, growth factors, and antibodies for targeted treatment of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders."
Isaac Cervantes Sandoval,Georgetown,Biology,Neurobiology?,Where did I leave my keys: Why do we forget?,"Have you ever wondered, ""why do we forget?"" Can you imagine a life where you could remember everything? Although this sounds interesting, it might not be a good idea, after all. Scientists have started to learn that forgetting is very important for the normal functioning of the brain. In this talk, we will cover the science behind memory forgetting. ","I received my MSc and Ph.D. in Chemical and Biological Sciences from the National School for Biological Sciences of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City, Mexico. During my graduate work, I focused on the physiopathology and host immune response in free-living amoebae infections, using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. These studies included the characterization of proteases of Acanthamoeba spp and Naegleria spp as possible virulence mechanisms. In addition, we also studied the role of inflammation in the amoebic meningoencephalitis using CD38-/- knockout mice and the importance of mucins in the innate resistance to Naegleria infections.

Upon the completion of my Ph.D., I decided to move into the more challenging field of Neuroscience. I joined the Neuroscience Department at The Scripps Research Institute in 2009 to expand my technical skills and neuroscience knowledge. There, my research has focused on understanding how memories are encoded, consolidated, retrieved, and, most recently, how these are forgotten. For this, I use the fruit fly as an animal model. One of our significant findings is that normal forgetting is an active, well-regulated process that involves dopaminergic signals, which depend on the behavioral state of the animal. 

In 2019 I moved as an Assistant Professor at Georgetown University, where I will continue to develop a research program to understand how memories are encoded in the brain and how they are forgotten.

Dr. Tom Hull, sdsdf, CS,Systems and Networking,Probabilistic Combinatorics,"Origami, the art of paper folding, has been practiced in Japan and all over the world for centuries. However, the past decade has witnessed a surge of interest in using origami for science. Applications in robotics, airbag design, deployment of space structures, and even medicine are appearing in the popular science press. Videos of origami robots folding themselves up and walking away or performing tasks have gone viral in recent years. What's more, the National Science Foundation has recently found origami valuable enough to fund millions of dollars for studying engineering and science applications of origami. But if the art of paper folding is so old, why has there been an increase in origami applications now? One answer is because of mathematics. Advances in our understanding of how folding processes work has arisen due to success in modeling origami mathematically. In this presentation we will explore why origami lends itself to mathematical study and see some of the applications that origami-math has inspired.","t."

Dr. Jane Frommer,CalTech (not a professor though),Chem,Nanotech,"the molecular underpinnings of nanotechnology
","Creating objects on the nanometer scale - the scale of single molecules - requires unambiguous tracking of features produced (steps performed) at each stage along the preparative pathway.  Complicating this tracking is the tendency for materials to display properties that are different on this very small scale than on larger and visible scales, a non-scaling behavior that is both intriguing and challenging.   

The evolution of instrumentation that is capable of reliably monitoring material behavior has been essential to ushering in the nanotech age.  Furthermore, the design of instruments that accurately analyze materials has been cleverly redirected toward manipulating and constructing landscapes on the nanometer scale, leading to the rapid growth in R&D of nanomanufacturing.  In this talk, the origin and evolution of molecular identification and manipulation will be traced through current day applications of nanotechnology. ","Dr. Jane Frommer received the 2020 Perkin Medal for bringing chemical awareness to

Anshul Kundaje,,,,Deep learning the regulatory code of the human genome,"The human genome contains the fundamental code that defines the identity and function of all the cell types and tissues in the human body. Genes are functional sequence units that encode for proteins. But they account for just about 2% of the 3 billion long human genome sequence. What does the rest of the genome encode? How is gene activity controlled in each cell type? Where do the regulatory control elements lie and what is their sequence composition? How do variants and mutations in the genome sequence affect cellular function and disease? These are fundamental questions that remain largely unanswered. The regulatory code that controls gene activity consists of DNA words with complex syntax and grammar (akin to natural language) encoded within hierarchically organized units of regulatory elements. These syntactic units of functional DNA words are sparsely distributed across billions of nucleotides of genomic sequence and remain largely elusive. Deep learning has revolutionized natural language, speech and vision applications. I will show that deep learning also has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the regulatory language of the genome. We have developed integrative supervised deep learning frameworks to learn how genomic sequence encodes millions of experimentally measured regulatory genomic events across 100s of cell types and tissues. We have developed novel methods to interpret our models and extract local and global predictive patterns revealing many insights into the regulatory code. We will demonstrate how we can use deep learning models as oracles and perform millions of in-silico experiments to reveal the regulatory code. Our models also allow us to predict the effects of natural and disease-associated genetic variation i.e. how differences in DNA sequence across healthy and diseased individuals are likely to affect molecular mechanisms associated with complex traits and diseases.","Anshul Kundaje is an Assistant Professor of Genetics and Computer Science at Stanford University. The Kundaje lab develops statistical and machine learning methods for large-scale integrative analysis of functional genomic data to decode regulatory elements and pathways across diverse cell types and tissues and understand their role in cellular function and disease.
