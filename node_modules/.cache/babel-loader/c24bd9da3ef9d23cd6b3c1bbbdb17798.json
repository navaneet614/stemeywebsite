They will be streamed over YouTube and Zoom and offer prizes to the top 10 competitors of each.\n</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"motivate item steps-item\">\n                        <ion-icon name=\"color-palette\"></ion-icon>\n                        <h2 style={{ fontWeight: \"100\", letterSpacing: \"4px\" }}>Free STEM Classes</h2>\n                        <p>STEMEY offers classes in biology, physics, calculus, competition math, geometry and algebra, chemistry, and introductory Java. These classes are modelled after honors and AP curricula. Each class has a Google Classroom where lectures, assignments, and activities are posted; students can use these resources to pick and choose when and what they learn. STEMEY’s instructors also offer weekly office hours. Some of these resources will take the form of mini-lectures that teach the real life applications of various STEM disciplines by detailing their interdisciplinary aspects, key innovations, and most fascinating concepts. See class descriptions here.\n</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"motivate item\">\n                        <ion-icon name=\"chatbox-ellipses\"></ion-icon>\n                        <h2 style={{ fontWeight: \"100\", letterSpacing: \"4px\" }}>FCSN-STEMEY Classes</h2>\n                        <p>STEMEY hosts classes in partnership with FCSN, Friends for Children with Special Needs, for Science and Mathematics.
