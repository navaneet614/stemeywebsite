She has also invented a class of biological nanoconstructs that are facilitating unique insight into nanoparticle-cell interactions and that show superior imaging and therapeutic properties because of their gold nanostar shape.\"\n                    imgURL = {odom}\n                /> \n\n                <Card \n                    name = \"Dr. Corina Constantinescu\"\n                    imgURL = {constantinescu}\n                    position = \"Professor of Mathematics at the University of Liverpool\" \n                    des = \"Corina Constantinescu is Professor of Mathematics and Director of the Institute for Financial and Actuarial Mathematics, in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, at the University of Liverpool.

Her academic career spans the US, Austria, France, and Switzerland and she often travels to Europe, Africa, Australia, India, China and Japan on research visits or conference meetings. Given her practical perspective, many of her papers are published in actuarial journals, however she also publishes in applied probability journals. She serves as associate editor in a number of actuarial journals and is part of the publicity team of Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability. During 2012-2016, she coordinated a large European grant under the Marie Curie framework, on Risk Analysis, Ruin and Extremes (RARE), that connected 12 higher education institutions and over 60 researchers from all over the world working on extreme events and their applications to insurance modelling. Her expertise is in analytical methods for deriving exact or asymptotic results for ruin probabilities, with light or heavy-tailed assumptions in complex insurance risk models.
